### Author - Anuroop Arya

## Project Goals and Aim

The primary goal of this project is to analyze and visualize key economic and social indicators of G20 countries. By leveraging data from the World Bank API, the project aims to provide comprehensive insights into how these indicators vary across countries and over time. The objectives include:

- Understanding the economic performance of G20 countries.
- Analyzing social indicators to gauge the quality of life.
- Providing a comparative analysis through interactive visualizations.
- Identifying trends and patterns that can inform policy and decision-making.

## What I Did

### Data Collection

- **Source**: World Bank API
- **Indicators Collected**:
  - **Economic Indicators**:
    1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
    2. Gross National Income (GNI)
    3. Inflation rate
    4. Foreign direct investment (FDI)
    5. Exports of goods and services
    6. Imports of goods and services
    7. Gross capital formation
    8. Agricultural land area
    9. Agricultural production index
  - **Social Indicators**:

    2. Poverty rate
    3. Life expectancy
    4. Literacy rate
    5. Access to electricity
    6. Mobile phone subscriptions
    7. Government expenditure on education

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Tools Used**: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Key Steps**:
  1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and outliers.
  2. **Data Transformation**: Normalized and scaled data where necessary.
  3. **Statistical Analysis**: Descriptive statistics to summarize data.
  4. **Visualization**: Created plots to identify trends and patterns.

### Visualization

- **Tool Used**: Power BI
- **Visualizations Created**:
  - Inflation Rate Over the Years
  - Country-wise Unemployment Rate
  - Access to Electricity
  - Efficacy of Government Education Spending
  - GDP vs Gross Capital Formation
  - Exports vs Imports
  - Mobile Subscriptions vs GNI
  - FDI Distributions

## Conclusions

- **Economic Performance**: The analysis revealed significant variations in GDP, GNI, and FDI among G20 countries, highlighting diverse economic landscapes.
- **Social Indicators**: There are stark differences in social indicators such as life expectancy, literacy rates, and access to electricity, pointing to varying quality of life and development stages.
- **Trends and Patterns**: Certain countries show consistent economic growth, while others face challenges like high unemployment rates and low government expenditure on education.
- **Policy Implications**: The insights from this analysis can help policymakers focus on areas needing improvement, such as increasing investment in education and infrastructure to boost overall development.
